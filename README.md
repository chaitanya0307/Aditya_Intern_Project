A clean, responsive, and interactive UI for the Aditya Birla Grasim Industries dashboard. This project uses modern CSS for styling and JavaScript for core interactivity—perfect for showcasing products, company info, and sustainability efforts.

  Buttons, cards, forms, hero overlay, and footer styled with hover effects and smooth transitions.

  - Hamburger menu toggle for mobile navigation  
  - Cookie consent banner with localStorage persistence
